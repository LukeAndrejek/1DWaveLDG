# 1DWaveLDG
Implement a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method to solve the one-dimensional wave equation. All code is written in MATLAB.

The LDG method is implemented in the file WaveLDG.m, which was written by me. This file calls the function gauss_points_and_weights.m, which was not written by me.

This code is discussed in the following YouTube videos:
